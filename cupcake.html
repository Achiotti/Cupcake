      <h1 class="flashy">Cupcakes from Hell</h1>
      <p>At Cupcakes from <strong class="flashy">Hell</strong>, we want to bring devilishly tantalizing bites straight from the depths of Hades to your mouth!</p>
      <p>We got our start baking while serving time in the <a href="https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_State_Penitentiary"><strong class="flashy">state's worst-rated penitentiary</strong></a> where we were assigned to work in the mess hall...right after our bathroom-cleaning shifts.</p>
      <p>A few parole officers and broken mixers later, now we're ready to bring our sweet creations to you.</p>
      <h2>Eat your heart out!</h2>
